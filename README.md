Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a paradigm where code is organized into **classes** (blueprints) and **objects** (instances), combining data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). It uses concepts like **inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction** to make programs modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
